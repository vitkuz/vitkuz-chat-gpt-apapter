        "content": "Let's denote the cost of the ball as x dollars. Since the bat costs $1.00 more than the ball, the bat's cost is (x + 1.00) dollars.\n\nAccording to the problem, the total cost of the bat and the ball is $1.10. So we can set up the equation:\n\n  x + (x + 1.00) = 1.10\n\nCombining like terms gives:\n\n  2x + 1.00 = 1.10\n\nTo solve for x, subtract 1.00 from both sides:\n\n  2x = 1.10 - 1.00  \n  2x = 0.10\n\nNow, divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n  x = 0.10 / 2  \n  x = 0.05\n\nSo, the cost of the ball is $0.05 (or 5 cents).\n\nStep-by-step summary:\n1. Let ball cost = x.\n2. Bat cost = x + $1.00.\n3. Total cost equation: x + (x + 1.00) = 1.10.\n4. Combine terms: 2x + 1.00 = 1.10.\n5. Subtract 1.00: 2x = 0.10.\n6. Divide by 2: x = 0.05.\n\nThus, the ball costs 5 cents.",
